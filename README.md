# enhancedcalling

## Overview
With Cisco EOL'ing hybrid services for Webex Cloud registered devices, Personal mode devices, lost PSTN calling capabilities, both inbound and outbound.

Cisco then came out with an interim/stop-gap solution, to address this gap in functionality, called Enhanced Calling.
This is a demonstration of how Enhanced Calling can be enabled, using On Premise CUCM deployment.

The API used in these examples are not "public" APIs. Meaning, they are not published at https://developer.webex.com and are subject to change without notice from Cisco.

But these are the same APIs that Control HUB UI makes use of.
The intent of this script is to solve the interim problem, till comes out with a more longer term solution.
